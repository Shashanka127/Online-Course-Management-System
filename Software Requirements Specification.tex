\chapter{Introduction}
Managing course registrations, monitoring of students' performance in each course and generating reports at colleges and universities are being done manually and majorly on paper. The student needs to check an information brochure, choose a course, and needs to physically go to the course registrar of the college to enroll in it. The registrar needs to ensure that the student is eligible to take up the courses they have chosen, and then enroll them in those courses by updating their database. Now, the professor needs to keep track of all his students using registers and also has to use separate software to keep track of grades of the students taking up their courses. This is time-consuming, cumbersome and hard to maintain in the long-term.
\\\\
This Online Course Reservation System aims to solve this by bringing the entire process online, eliminating physical involvement in the process as well as remove the need for a lot of paper work.
The system will allow The professors will be able to set the syllabus, lesson plan and other details such as eligibility. They will be able to post announcements, create \& collect assignments and provide resources for the course. They can also grade students and generate reports.
The students will be able to register for courses offered by the university professors. They will be able to access the course resources, submit assignments and monitor their progress in each course they take up. They will also be able to discuss and clarify doubts in a public forum created for each course.

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to describe the external behavior of the Online Course Reservation System. Requirements Specification defines and describes the operations, interfaces, performance, and quality assurance requirements of the Online Course Reservation System. The document also describes the nonfunctional requirements such as the user interfaces.
It also describes the design constraints that are to be considered when the system is to be designed, and other factors necessary to provide a complete and comprehensive description of the requirements for the software. The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) captures the complete software requirements for the system.

\section{Scope}
The Online Course Reservation System provides students the ability to register for courses online as well as monitor their performance in assignments and tests of the courses they have registered for. It allows professors an easy way to manage all the classes that they handle, and have a clear idea of how their students in each course and class are performing, using automatically created reports.
The system is supposed to have the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system allows Students, Professors and a System Administrator to logon to the system all day long.
    \item The professors of the university will be able to create and manage courses.
    \item They can set the syllabus, lesson plan and other details such as eligibility during creation.
    \item They will be able to post announcements, create \& collect assignments and provide resources for the course.
    \item They will be able to assign grades for students for the assignments, and also for tests that may be conducted offline.
    \item They will be able to generate a report for any course they are managing at any point of time.
    \item The students will be able to register for courses offered by the university professors.
    \item They will be able to access the course resources, submit assignments and monitor their progress in each course they take up.
    \item They will be able to discuss and clarify doubts in a public forum created for each course.
    \item The system administrator will have the job of maintaining the system throughout its working.
    \item They will be able to approve or decline courses that have been created by professors, and will also be able to do the same to registrations made by students.
    \item They will have direct access to the database as well, and can manage all the users that are registered on the system.
\end{enumerate}

The features that are described in this document are used in the future phases of the software development cycle. The features described here meet the needs of all the users. The success criteria for the system is based in the level up to which the features described in this document are implemented in the system.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product perspective}
The Online Course Reservation System that facilitates the management of courses in a university.
\\\\
The professors of the university will be able to create and manage courses. They can set the syllabus, lesson plan and other details such as eligibility during creation. They will be able to post announcements, create \& collect assignments and provide resources for the course. They can also grade students and generate reports.
\\\\
The students will be able to register for courses offered by the university professors. They will be able to access the course resources, submit assignments and monitor their progress in each course they take up. They will also be able to discuss and clarify doubts in a public forum created for each course.
\\\\
The system administrator's role is minor in volume but vital in the entire working of the system. They have the capability to approve/decline courses created by the professors to provide human monitoring of the creating of courses, to account for many possibilities of human error. They can also deregister a student from a course if need be under some circumstances.
