# Online Course Reservation System

## Problem Statement
To develop an Online Course Reservation System where students can search and
register for courses offered by the university. The students will be able to view important
details such as progress, grades, attendance etc. for each course they have registered
for. The professors will be able to set the curriculum, the lesson plan and the structure
of the courses they are teaching. They will be able to create, collect and grade
assignments & tests for the students. They will be able to see useful statistical
information about the students taking their course and review the performance of each
student individually.
