\chapter{Introduction}
Managing course registrations, monitoring of students' performance in each course and generating reports at colleges and universities are being done manually and majorly on paper. The student needs to check an information brochure, choose a course, and needs to physically go to the course registrar of the college to enroll in it. The registrar needs to ensure that the student is eligible to take up the courses they have chosen, and then enroll them in those courses by updating their database. Now, the professor needs to keep track of all his students using registers and also has to use separate software to keep track of grades of the students taking up their courses. This is time-consuming, cumbersome and hard to maintain in the long-term.
\\\\
This Online Course Management System aims to solve this by bringing the entire process online, eliminating physical involvement in the process as well as remove the need for a lot of paper work.
The system will allow The professors will be able to set the syllabus, lesson plan and other details such as eligibility. They will be able to post announcements, create \& collect assignments and provide resources for the course. They can also grade students and generate reports.
The students will be able to register for courses offered by the university professors. They will be able to access the course resources, submit assignments and monitor their progress in each course they take up. They will also be able to discuss and clarify doubts in a public forum created for each course.

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to describe the external behavior of the Online Course Management System. Requirements Specification defines and describes the operations, interfaces, performance, and quality assurance requirements of the Online Course Management System. The document also describes the nonfunctional requirements such as the user interfaces.
It also describes the design constraints that are to be considered when the system is to be designed, and other factors necessary to provide a complete and comprehensive description of the requirements for the software. The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) captures the complete software requirements for the system.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Scope}
The Online Course Management System provides students the ability to register for courses online as well as monitor their performance in assignments and tests of the courses they have registered for. It allows professors an easy way to manage all the classes that they handle, and have a clear idea of how their students in each course and class are performing, using automatically created reports.
The system is supposed to have the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system allows Students, Professors and a System Administrator to logon to the system all day long.
    \item The professors of the university will be able to create and manage courses.
    \item They can set the syllabus, lesson plan and other details such as eligibility during creation.
    \item They will be able to post announcements, create \& collect assignments and provide resources for the course.
    \item They will be able to assign grades for students for the assignments, and also for tests that may be conducted offline.
    \item They will be able to generate a report for any course they are managing at any point of time.
    \item The students will be able to register for courses offered by the university professors.
    \item They will be able to access the course resources, submit assignments and monitor their progress in each course they take up.
    \item They will be able to discuss and clarify doubts in a public forum created for each course.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}
The features that are described in this document are used in the future phases of the software development cycle. The features described here meet the needs of all the users. The success criteria for the system is based in the level up to which the features described in this document are implemented in the system.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product perspective}
The Online Course Management System that facilitates the management of courses in a university.
\\\\
The professors of the university will be able to create and manage courses. They can set the syllabus, lesson plan and other details such as eligibility during creation. They will be able to post announcements, create \& collect assignments and provide resources for the course. They can also grade students and generate reports.
\\\\
The students will be able to register for courses offered by the university professors. They will be able to access the course resources, submit assignments and monitor their progress in each course they take up. They will also be able to discuss and clarify doubts in a public forum created for each course.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Product Functions}
The Online Course Management System acts as an interface between the Students and the Professors, with minor human monitoring by the system administrator.
\\\\
The major functions of The Online Course Registration System include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Professors should be able to create, manage and monitor multiple courses courses that they have offered.
    \item Professors should be able to post announcements, create \& collect assignments and provide resources for the course.
    \item Professors should also be able to grade students and generate reports.
    \item Students should be able to register \& monitor their performance and manage courses that they have registered for. 
    \item Students should be able to access the course resources, submit assignments and monitor their progress in each course they take up.
    \item Students should be able to discuss and clarify doubts the public forum of the course.
\end{enumerate}

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{User Characteristics}
The users of the system are students and the professors of the university.
The students \& professors are assumed to have basic knowledge of the computers and Internet browsing.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Operating Environment}
The Online Course Management System will be implemented as a WebApp, which can be accessed using any internet browser that is up-to-date and supports the HTML5, CSS3 and JS6. It is therefore platform-independent, and can be run on any Operating System that has support from any major Web Browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge etc.

\section{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The applicants require a computer with a working internet connection to access the Online Course Management System, access course content, submit assignments etc.
    \item The system must be up to date and support HTML5, CSS3 and JS6 in order for the website to render as intended and be used without any hassle.
